"""Compute per-rule health metrics from the structured auditor logs.

Runs SCHEMAS §Learning query over the three append-only logs and
classifies every rule_id as healthy, noisy, dormant, or disputed.

Inputs (paths are relative to the repo root):
    auditor/findings.jsonl          — one record per finding
    auditor/logs/events.jsonl       — finding_outcome + finding_verified + finding_introduced events (filtered)
    auditor/disagreements.jsonl     — self_fp, maintainer_rejected, pr_comments_snapshot, downstream_suppression
    auditor/registry/repos.json     — rule-adopted repos, total repos audited

Output (argv[1] or stdout): a JSON blob with
    summary.*            — PR scorecard numbers (drop-in replacement for the old feedback-summary.json)
    rule_metrics[rid]    — hits, contributed, merged, closed_unmerged, open, self_fp,
                           maintainer_rejected, downstream_suppressions, dissent_types,
                           verified_fixed, verified_persists, verify_rate, introduced, state
    dormant_rules[]      — R* rules in the catalog with zero hits
    unclassified_ids[]   — non-catalog rule_ids seen in findings (SEC-*, BUG-*, CC-*)
    metadata.*           — totals, updated_at

The `verified_*` metrics come from finding_verified events emitted by the
post-merge re-audit (auditor-case-study.yml). They give effect-level
precision: `merged / contributed` says "maintainer accepted our PR";
`verified_fixed / verified_total` says "re-running the scorer confirms
the rule's target is actually gone from the code". When both are present,
rule state classification weights the verified signal above the merged one.

All reads are tolerant: missing files produce zeros, malformed JSONL
lines are skipped with a warning to stderr.
